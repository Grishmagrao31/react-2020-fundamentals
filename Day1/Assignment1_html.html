        <p>React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for
            building user interfaces.<br>
            You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app
            from scratch.React primitives render
            to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.<br> <strong>Many
                platforms,</strong>one React.
            Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With
            React Native, one team can maintain two platforms and share a common technologyâ€”React.</p>
